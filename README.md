# LUE_CO2

This is the source code of analysis presented in EGU2021, abstract EGU21-1744, "Sensitivity of global gross primary production to elevated CO2".

The goal of these codes is to analyse and compare the sensitivity of LUE to elevated CO~2~ from three different representation of vegetation models. It also explore the impact of Jmax/Vcmax ratio and convexity of light response curve to LUE sensitivity.
